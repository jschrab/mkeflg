# mkeflg
6502 assembly to render The People's Flag of Milwaukee on the Atari 2600. A HUGE amount of direction and kernel patterns from:
### [Atari 2600 Programming for Newbies](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-01.html)
#### By Andrew Davie (adapted by Duane Alan Hahn, a.k.a. Random Terrain)

Compiled with [DASM 2.20.13](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/)

Nothing practical going on here - just an excuse to write some 6502 assembly.
